# keyboard2

This is a DIY 69% (nice) mechanical keyboard. Mostly to be used for DIY
computers, but there's a provision for USB/PS2 connection too.

Keyboard has been tested in the [FellaPC](https://github.com/agkaminski/FellaPC)
project and proven 100% functional. USB/PS2 connection has not been tested yet.
